### Creating the database using SQL

We use SQL to create the database and insert values to it. Please refer to the script below for detailed code. <br>

[Database creation](https://github.com/ouidhi/library-db-design/blob/1233e04c9b75c86a1a65439fbe11b4b2cc641755/dbs_creation.sql)
#
## üîç Example Queries & Insights

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Books with ‚â• 6 copies` | Inventory insights |
| `Top 3 popular genres` | Genre demand ranking |
| `Members with no transactions` | Inactive user discovery |
| `Books from Sci-Fi & Fantasy` | Genre-based filtering via view |
| `City with most members` | Demographic insights |
| `Addresses with ‚ÄòAvenue‚Äô` | Address pattern search |
| `Members more active than ID 23` | Transaction volume comparison |
| `Books checked out in November` | Monthly usage trends |

See [`queries.sql`](https://github.com/ouidhi/library-db-design/blob/1233e04c9b75c86a1a65439fbe11b4b2cc641755/queries.sql) for the SQL statements.

#

### 2. **City with Maximum and Minimum Members in Ascending Order**

This query finds the cities with the maximum and minimum number of members, sorted by the number of members in ascending order.

```sql
-- City with max members
(SELECT city, COUNT(memberid) AS "NO_OF_MEMBERS"
FROM members
GROUP BY city
HAVING COUNT(memberid) = (SELECT MAX(COUNT)
                          FROM (SELECT city, COUNT(memberid) AS "COUNT"
                                FROM members
                                GROUP BY city)))
UNION
-- City with min members
(SELECT city, COUNT(memberid) AS "NO_OF_MEMBERS"
FROM members
GROUP BY city
HAVING COUNT(memberid) = (SELECT MIN(COUNT)
                          FROM (SELECT city, COUNT(memberid) AS "COUNT"
                                FROM members
                                GROUP BY city)))
ORDER BY NO_OF_MEMBERS;
```

### 3. **Cities with Addresses Containing 'Avenue'**

This query finds the number of addresses that contain the word 'Avenue' in each city, ordered by the number of occurrences.

```sql

FROM members
WHERE lower(address) LIKE '%avenue%'
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY HAS_AVENUE;
```

### 4. **Number of Books Checked Out in November by Each Member**

This query retrieves member IDs and the number of books they checked out during the month of November.

```sql
SELECT memberid, TO_CHAR(checkoutdate, 'MON') AS "MONTH", COUNT(bookid) AS "COUNT_BOOKS"
FROM transactions
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM checkoutdate) = 11
GROUP BY memberid, checkoutdate
ORDER BY memberid, COUNT(bookid);
```

### Conclusion

This SQL database project demonstrates the creation and management of a library system database. The design follows best practices for relational databases, including the use of normalization to reduce redundancy and maintain data integrity through primary and foreign key constraints. 

Key takeaways from the project include:
- Proper database structuring, ensuring easy retrieval and management of data for members, books, authors, publishers, genres, and transactions.
- Complex queries utilizing `JOINs`, views, and aggregations to deliver insights such as identifying top genres, members with more transactions, and books from specific genres.
- Data integrity is maintained by enforcing constraints on relationships between entities, such as foreign key relationships between books and authors, books and genres, and transactions involving members.
  
The database is ready for integration into a larger system that could include a user interface for library staff to manage inventory, members, and transactions efficiently. This system also ensures scalability and the ability to run complex queries for future reporting and analysis needs.
